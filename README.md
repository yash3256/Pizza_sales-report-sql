## Project Overview

The Pizza Sale Report Project aims to provide a detailed analysis of pizza sales. The project involves creating a relational database, importing sales data, and writing SQL queries to generate various reports. These reports include total sales, sales by pizza type, sales by time period, and more.

## Features

- Database schema creation
- Data import scripts
- SQL queries for generating sales reports
- Sample data for testing
- Detailed documentation

## Database Schema

The database schema includes the following tables:

1. **Customers**: Information about customers
   - `customer_id` (Primary Key)
   - `name`
   - `email`
   - `phone`

2. **Pizzas**: Information about different types of pizzas
   - `pizza_id` (Primary Key)
   - `pizza_name`
   - `price`

3. **Orders**: Information about pizza orders
   - `order_id` (Primary Key)
   - `customer_id` (Foreign Key)
   - `order_date`

4. **Order_Items**: Information about pizzas in each order
   - `order_item_id` (Primary Key)
   - `order_id` (Foreign Key)
   - `pizza_id` (Foreign Key)
   - `quantity`

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pizza-sale-report.git
   cd pizza-sale-report
   ```

2. Set up the database:
   - Ensure you have a SQL database installed (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
   - Create the database and tables using the provided schema.sql script:
     ```sh
     mysql -u yourusername -p yourdatabase < schema.sql
     ```

3. Import sample data:
   ```sh
   mysql -u yourusername -p yourdatabase < data.sql
   ```

## Usage

To generate the sales reports, execute the SQL queries provided in the `queries` directory. Each query is designed to produce a specific report. For example:

- **Total Sales**:
  ```sql
  SELECT SUM(price * quantity) AS total_sales
  FROM Order_Items
  JOIN Pizzas ON Order_Items.pizza_id = Pizzas.pizza_id;
  ```

- **Sales by Pizza Type**:
  ```sql
  SELECT pizza_name, SUM(price * quantity) AS total_sales
  FROM Order_Items
  JOIN Pizzas ON Order_Items.pizza_id = Pizzas.pizza_id
  GROUP BY pizza_name;
  ```

## SQL Queries

The `queries` directory contains various SQL files for generating reports:

- `total_sales.sql`: Calculate the total sales revenue.
- `sales_by_pizza_type.sql`: Calculate sales revenue by pizza type.
- `sales_by_date.sql`: Calculate sales revenue by date.

To run these queries, you can use your SQL client or command line tools.
